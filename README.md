# Dicer
### Dicer is a basic DnD 5e stat rolling simulator.
### Made by Alexandra Pasinski (Dustyamp)

The simulation uses the following rules when rolling for stats:
1. Stats are rolled using four six-sided dice with the lowest dice roll being dropped.
1. No more than two stat rolls can be less than or equal to 8.
1. No fewer than two stat rolls must be greater than or equal to 15.

The simulator has been tested on Windows 10 using Python 3.8.2.
